* CPU Scheduling Simulator (Core Java):-

This project is a console-based CPU Scheduling Simulator developed using Core Java.
It simulates and compares common operating system CPU scheduling algorithms by executing processes from an input file and calculating performance metrics.

* Implemented Algorithms:-
First Come First Serve (FCFS)
Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)
Round Robin (RR)

* Technologies Used:-
Java (Core Java)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Java Collections Framework
Operating System Scheduling Concepts
